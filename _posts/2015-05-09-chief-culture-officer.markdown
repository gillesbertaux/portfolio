Here’s an idea I had the other day after watching [“Hiring and Culture”](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/) from the startup class series. Here’s what could be a job offer for a Chief Culture Officer. His job would be to help the CEO maintain and coordinate the culture attributes of a company. Such position would probably be relevant only after reaching a certain size and maturity.

## Responsabilites

Coordinating a vision and core values can be really challenging once you have reached a certain size and maturity. Keeping the message clear and unaltered for every employee, recruit or candidate is a long-term undertaking. You will be in charge of building strategies and lead actions to keep that message loud and clear.

* Lead and coordinate the HR departement and the marketing department to elaborate “culture strategies”.
* Ensure that every interaction from the employees are marked with the company’s DNA.

## Requirements

* Deeply understand and integrate the history, core values and principles of the company.
* Have constantly an empathic and psychological approach to understand any context or subject.
* Creativity to elaborate new ways of promoting the company’s culture.
* Leadership to coordinate departments, teams and people from different backgrounds and make them converge to one single objective.
* Have range, be comfortable around different backgrounds to understand how they receive and apply the company’s culture into their daily activity.
* Great communication and social skills.

Let me know what you think about having a CCO and its role. Also, do not hesitate to make suggestions for the job requirements, I will be happy to update this post.
