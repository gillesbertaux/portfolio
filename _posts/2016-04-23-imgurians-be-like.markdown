## One of us

I’ve been using Imgur for almost a year now. I did not use to spend time on Imgur or 9gag or whatever before.

I wonder sometimes what the hell I used to do with my time before Imgur. But I can't help telling myself that I should have started sooner.

I don't post often, and, unlike on HN or Designer News, I'm not running after karma. But, unlike HN or Designer News, I can keep browsing the feed for hours.

What do I find in this? It's hard to say. Confort? What problem is Imgur solving for me? None. And, hell, I don’t mind. I guess it's ok to have that one app you can go to shamelessly procrastinate.

On a different matter, I find fascinating how they built this "home" for their community. I think Imgur is way more than just a simple image sharing platform.

For an outsider, it seems sometimes as if the platform was an entire private joke between its members.

They really created a place for a community with its own norms, figures and language to emerge.

Of course, similar products managed to become such community-driven platforms. 9gag, 4chan or Reddit also have their respective culture. Still, I'm not sure there's a lot of places that combines this amount of people and such strong culture.

The best example of this appropriation is when you read the never ending debates on whether X or Y is better. I don't have a decided opinion on this matter. I guess everyone can relate to certain characteristics within a group.

Anyway, after a year of browsing Imgur I managed to gather 30 reasons why I love it so much. Also, there's a lot of references in there, so if you get them then you're probably one of us ;)
